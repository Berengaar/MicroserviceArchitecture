<b><span style="color:aliceblue">=></span> This layer is a middleware for common objects in the project. I used  .Net Core (3.1) for this layer. Because the identity library we will use for 5.0 is paid. But for 3.1 is free. Also if you want you can use Core 5.0 with identity library's old versions but it can create some problems. I preferred like this.
